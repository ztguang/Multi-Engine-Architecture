We have installed client-manet on node N11. The program client-manet is used to simulate the access of workflow system by sending data to server-manet running on node N10. Meanwhile, node N10 sends synchronous process state data and executes data to nodes N1~N9. By double clicking node N6, N8~N11, we obtain the terminal windows shown in Fig. 7~Fig. 10. 

The testing steps are as following.

1. Execute command ./server-manet; the output is line ①, as shown in Fig. 7.

2. Execute command ./server-manet in nodes N6 and N8 respectively; the outputs are lines ①⑥ in Fig. 8 and lines ②③ in Fig. 7.

3. Execute command ./server-manet in node N9; the outputs are line ① in Fig. 9 and line ④ in Fig. 7.

4. Execute command ./client-manet in nodes N11; the outputs are lines ①② in Fig. 10. Node N11 sends data to node N10 which then sends data to nodes N1~N9; the outputs are lines ②⑦ in Fig. 8 and line ② in Fig. 9. Upon finish of the command ./client-manet, the output is shown in line ⑤ in Fig. 7.

5. Now, we move node N10 to a new location in the bottom right of Fig. 11.  At this point the network topology is changed, and the server-manet (Multi-MPE Trigger Algorithm) is being executed to elect node N9 as M-MSD, as shown in line ③ in Fig. 9. Node N10 is elected as S-MSD, as shown in line ⑥ in Fig. 7. It cannot access M-MSD due to the disconnection to the network, as shown in lines ⑦~⑩ in Fig. 7. The server-manet is being executed for nodes N6 and N8 in Fig. 8. Nodes N6 and N8 are elected as S-MSDs again (lines ③⑧ in Fig. 8) and connect to M-MSD (lines ④⑤ in Fig. 9), 

6. Execute command ./client-manet in node N11 again (line ③ in Fig. 10), the outputs are lines ④⑤ in Fig. 10. Node N11 sends data to node N9 which then sends data to nodes N1~N8; the outputs are lines ④⑨ in Fig. 8. Upon finish of command ./client-manet, line ⑥ displays the output in Fig. 9.

7. Now, we move node N10 to the original location, as shown in Fig. 11. At this point the network topology is changed, and node N10 is elected as S-MSD to connect to M-MSD (line ⑦ in Fig. 9). 

8. Execute command ./client-manet in node N11 again (line ⑥ in Fig. 10); the outputs are lines ⑦⑧ in Fig. 10. Node N11 sends data to node N9 which then sends data to nodes N1~N8 and N10. The outputs are shown by line ⑪ in Fig. 7 and lines ⑤⑩in Fig. 8. Upon finish of command ./client-manet, line ⑧ shows the output in Fig. 9.
